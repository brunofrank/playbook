Playbook
========

This playbook describes how we work, how we build software and how we run our company.

Everyone in Magrathea can edit this playbook by simply opening a MR with the desired modifications. In this way, we can discuss all modifications through the MR and keep the discussion archived for future references.

Planning
--------

* All projects are specified in PRDs (**P**roduct **R**equirements **D**ocuments) in our [Google Drive PRD folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6m7dowklNjvUTVIcURiazBoM2s).
  * PRDs should follow the [PRD template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IU_-NaHIaXniNpa-qpl_55tIdeLmi5TYVDpbrSTc-jk/edit).
  * Project's contract should follow the [contract template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xhk0-s2k5ONhC2Z8gpXpPzlFagnDH7Y7D208jq-D69U/edit).
* Tasks are created and managed on [Trello](https://trello.com/):
  * Each project has its own board.
  * Tasks are estimated using the Finobacci sequence:
    * 1 point: 1/4 day of work;
    * 2 points: 1/2 day of work;
    * 3 points: 1 day of work;
    * 5 points: 2~3 days of work (should be splitted into smaller tasks);
    * 8 points: 1 week of work (should be splitted into smaller tasks).

Developing
----------

* Best practices:
  * All code should be written in English.
* Git:
  * Each task should have its own feature branch.
  * Prefer creating small MRs (changing ~500 LOC at most).
* Style:
  * [Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
  * [Elixir style guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide)
  * [JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

General Guidelines
------------------

High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

A note on the language:

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
* "Use" is a positive instruction.
