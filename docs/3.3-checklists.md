# Development Checklists

All good software must follow some guidelines. Here are the checklists that we at MLabs try to accomplish in our projects. They are not limited to developers; designers and bussiness men are also involved in this process.

Note that each project has its pecularities and therefore may not need to follow all the guidelines. An example would be a bot in Messenger; it does need to take into consideration the Front-End section regarding Meta Tags and CSS testing.

## [Code Review](http://blog.fogcreek.com/increase-defect-detection-with-our-code-review-checklist-example/)

### General

* Does the code work? Does it perform its intended function, the logic is correct etc.
* Is all the code easily understood?
* Does it conform to your agreed coding conventions? These will usually cover location of braces, variable and function names, line length, indentations, formatting, and comments.
* Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
* Is there any commented out code?

### Security

* Are all data inputs checked (for the correct type, length, format, and range) and encoded?
* Are invalid parameter values handled?

### Documentation

* Is any unusual behavior or edge-case handling described?
* Are data structures and units of measurement explained?
* Is there any incomplete code? If so, should it be removed or flagged with a suitable marker like ‘TODO’

### Testing

* Is the code testable? i.e. don’t add too many or hide dependencies, unable to initialize objects, test frameworks can use methods etc.
* Do tests exist and are they comprehensive? i.e. has at least your agreed on code coverage.
* Do unit tests actually test that the code is performing the intended functionality?

## [Front-End](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist)

### Head

* Doctype: The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

```html
<!doctype html> <!-- HTML5 -->
```

* Charset:  The charset (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

* Viewport: The viewport is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Viewport for responsive web design -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```

* Title: is used on all pages. The average character would be around 55-characters.

```html
<!-- Document Title -->
<title>Page Title less than 55 characters</title>
```

* Description: A meta description is provided, it is unique and doesn't possess more than 150 characters.

```html
<!-- Meta Description -->
<meta name="description" content="Description of the page less than 150 characters">
```

* Language attribute: The lang attribute of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

```html
<html lang="en">
```

* CSS order: All CSS files are loaded before any JavaScript files in the `<head>`.

### HTML

* HTML5 Semantic Elements: HTML5 Semantic Elements are used appropriately (header, section, footer, main...).
* Error pages: Error 404 page and 5xx exist.
* W3C compliant: All pages need to be tested with the W3C validator to identify possible issues in the HTML code.
* HTML Lint: I use tools to help me analyze any issues I could have on my HTML code.

### CSS

* Responsive Web Design: The website is using responsive web design.
* Unique ID: If IDs are used, they are unique to a page.
* Embedded or inline CSS: Avoid at all cost embedding CSS in `<style>` tags or using inline CSS.
* Concatenation: CSS files are concatenated in a single file (Not for HTTP/2).
* Minification: All CSS files are minified.
* Stylelint: All CSS or SCSS files are without any errors.
* Responsive web design: All pages were tested at the following breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px
* Desktop Browsers: All pages were tested on all current desktop browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, EDGE...).

### Images

* Optimization: All images are optimized to be rendered in the browser.
* Width and Height: Set width and height attributes on `<img>` if the final rendered image size is known.
* Alternative text: All `<img>` have an alternative text which describe the image visually.

### JavaScript

* JavaScript Inline: You don't have any JavaScript code inline (mixed with your HTML code).
* Concatenation: JavaScript files are concatenated.
* Minification: JavaScript files are minified (you can add the .min suffix).
* JavaScript security: [Guidelines for Developing Secure Applications Utilizing JavaScript](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Guidelines_for_Developing_Secure_Applications_Utilizing_JavaScript)
* ESLint: No errors are flagged by ESLint.

### Security

* Cross Site Scripting (XSS): Your page or website is free from XSS possible issues.
* Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): You ensure that requests made to your server-side are legitimate and originate from your website / app to prevent CSRF attacks.

### Performance

* Google PageSpeed: All your pages were tested (not only the homepage) and have a score of at least 90/100.

### Accessibility

* H1: All pages have an H1 which is not the title of the website.
* Headings: Headings should be used properly and in the right order (H1 to H6).
* Label: A label is associated with each input form element.


## [Usability](https://stayintech.com/UX)

### User experience

* Registering provides value to users. Unnecessary registration is avoided.
* Sample content. For example there is a sample newsletter next to a newsletter sign up form.
* Transparent pricing. There are no hidden costs or surprises in the terms.

### Accessibility

* Alt attributes are provided for non-text elements, such as images and maps.
* Accessible navigation. Site can be navigated with a keyboard, without using a mouse.
* Links, buttons and checkboxes are easily clickable.

### Search

* There is a search feature, in case of a large website.
* Search is available on every page, not just the homepage.
* Search box is wide enough, so that users can see what they've typed.

### Forms

* Long dropdown menus are avoided. Instead users can input text.
* Form submission is confirmed, so that the user knows data was successfully sent.
* Error messages are shown next to the input field, not just on top of the page.

### Homepage

* Clear call for action. Users understand the value proposition and purpose of the site.
* First impression. The homepage creates a positive first impression and supports conversion.
* Logged in user's name is displayed on the site.
* Company location and contact information is easily accessible from the homepage.

### Content

* Contrast. There is adequate contrast between the text and background.
* Content is scannable. There are short paragraphs, descriptive headings, lists and images.
